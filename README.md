## Axios AJAX Giphy Homework

For homework, you'll practice what we learned today ad return a random gif from the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/explorer).

Giphy requires an API key (it's free). However, I've given you the random endpoint with a working API key in the `script.js` file.

```js
const giphyRandomApiUrl = `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=2041494ca782403cb6055682a7943c75&tag=&rating=G`
```
